# Youtube_Analysis
Analysing the trends in Youtube using EDA
A short project on Youtube Analysis where I did some analysis on sentiments of people, how they reacted to certain videos. 
Also I did some analysis on how many good or bad words are there in a comment box. 
I did emoji analysis, most liked category on youtube and much more, all are in headings. 
I also attached the resourses and the exported data files in this repo. I had to compress it cuz GITHUB doesn't allow files more than 100MB.
Happy Coding.
